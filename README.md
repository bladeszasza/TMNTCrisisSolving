## 🔍 **Under the Hood**

### 🌟 **OpenFloor Protocol Magic**
This system showcases the **true power** of standardized multi-agent communication:

- **Natural Turn-Taking**: No rigid scripts, agents coordinate organically
- **Context Preservation**: Every agent knows what happened before
- **Priority Management**: Important agents can interrupt when needed

### 🧪 **The Secret Sauce**
```typescript
// Agents analyze input using AI to determine relevance
const interestDecisions = await this.gatherAgentInterest(conversationId, newMessage);

// Natural floor management - no scripts needed!
for (const decision of interestedAgents) {
  await this.facilitateAgentContribution(conversationId, decision.agentId);
}
```

## 🎪 **Try These Epic Scenarios**

### 🚨 **"Operation Retro Doom"** *(Built-in Default)*
A complex multi-threat scenario involving dimensional portals, mind control VHS tapes, and arcade sabotage!

### 🌃 **Custom Crisis** *(Your Imagination)*
```bash
# Edit the userMessage in src/test-natural-conversation.ts
# Create your own crisis scenario and watch the agents respond!
```
