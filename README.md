## 🔍 **Under the Hood**

### 🌟 **OpenFloor Protocol Magic**
This system showcases the **true power** of standardized multi-agent communication:

- **Natural Turn-Taking**: No rigid scripts, agents coordinate organically
- **Context Preservation**: Every agent knows what happened before
- **Priority Management**: Important agents can interrupt when needed
- **Error Recovery**: System handles failures gracefully

### 🧪 **The Secret Sauce**
```typescript
// Agents analyze input using AI to determine relevance
const interestDecisions = await this.gatherAgentInterest(conversationId, newMessage);

// Natural floor management - no scripts needed!
for (const decision of interestedAgents) {
  await this.facilitateAgentContribution(conversationId, decision.agentId);
}
```
